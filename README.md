# Shopify App Node

This repository provides a sample app that helps developers kickstart their Shopify app development. It utilizes the Shopify API Library on the backend to create an embedded app in the Shopify admin interface, and employs Polaris and App Bridge React on the frontend.

To use this repository, you need a Shopify partner account and a development store where you can install and test your app. If you're not using the Shopify CLI, you also need to create a new app in the Partner dashboard to obtain the necessary API credentials.

To install the app, you can either use the Shopify CLI by running `shopify app create node -n APP_NAME`, or manually clone the repository using `npx degit shopify/shopify-app-node` and set up a `.env` file with your API credentials, scopes, and app host.

For further resources and documentation, you can refer to the introduction to Shopify apps, app authentication, the Shopify CLI command reference, and the Shopify API Library documentation.
